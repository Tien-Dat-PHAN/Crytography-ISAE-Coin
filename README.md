# Crytography-ISAE-Coin

The objective of this work is to build your own blockchain in Python. In particular, you will implement simplified versions of the following concepts :
    
    - the state of a blockchain
    - the transactions
    - the blocks
    - the blockchain
    - the smart contracts
    - the consensus
 
The main objective of these work is to allow you to understand the concepts and not to code them efficiently. For example, a transaction will be an object of the class Transaction and a block will also be an object of the class Block which contains several objects of type Transaction. 

The concepts will be presented in several notebooks. You will write your first tests of the notebook, but we encourage you to gather the contributions in some python files. Indeed, some classes will be introduced to present a concept, but will be modidified later when another concept will be introduced.
